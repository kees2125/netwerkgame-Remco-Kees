## About ##

PlayAllTheGames is an idea we got a week before we held a lanparty....let's make some fun, small games to play on a big screen, with 4 controllers, that anyone can learn in 5 seconds and are still fun to play. We started out with a small framework with 8 small games and crappy graphics, but even this first version got played for several hours. After this success, we decided to expand this concept, and add more games and gamemodes. This became PlayAllTheGames. On this website you can find some info, screenshots, videos, but we'll mostly use it as a dump for the images.

## Answers to questions ##

- How do you control these games?
	- You control them with a controller
- How many players are supported?
	- This depends on the game. Games can support any number of players, depending on how many controllers you have connected. Most games will be 4-player-based though
- Is this fun to play?
	- yes
- Why do the games sometimes resemble Mario Party or Wario Ware games?
	- we know nothing of these games
- Why is the website so ugly?
	- because we use our time to make games, not websites
